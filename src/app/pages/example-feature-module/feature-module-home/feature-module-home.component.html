    <h1>Lazy-Loaded Feature Module</h1>

    <p>This feature module was loaded lazily.</p>

    <p>This module represents a good example of how to build sub-modules within your app. "Sub-modules" or "feature
        modules" are a design pattern that allows you to group similar functional areas together. By providing such
        pages as a collection in a feature module, you will have the advantage of being able to load all related pages
        together at the same time. Additionally, sub-modules can be "lazy loaded", which means they are not served with
        the initial app bundle but, rather, on demand when the user hits a route served by the sub-module.</p>

    <p>It is highly recommended that your app be divided in this way into sub-modules and not as top-level, individual
        page components.</p>

    <p>To take advantage of this design pattern for your app, delete example-page-1 and example-page-2 at src/app/pages/
        and transform this sub-module (example-feature-module) as you see fit.</p>
